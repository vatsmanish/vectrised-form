vecterisied form in multiple linear regression model
In machine learning filed, advanced players have the need to write their own cost function or optimization algorithm in achieving a more customized model, not just using existing machine learning libraries. In order to fully take advantage of computation power of todayâ€™s computers, the state of art of implementation of algorithm is vectorizing all the computations. This allows you to achieve parallelized computation, for example fully use the processors of GPU. In this post, the implementation of vectorization of machine learing is introduced.
